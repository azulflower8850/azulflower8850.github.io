				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>I am sophomore at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. While not declared, I plan to major in either General Engineering with a concentration in Computing, or Robotic Engineering. I am currently stuck in a love triangle between software and robots, and as a growing boy hungry for knowledge, I just can't say no to either one!</p>

				<p>Despite my life struggles with these two lovely subjects, I do have an extensive software background. I have taken 4 years of formal training in Java programming, and I have also taken a college level course on Python. In addition, I have self-taught myself C++, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and some C, PHP, and SQL. I am also an extremely fast learner: I learned both HTML5 and JavaScript to a proficient level in about a week each, so I am confident that I can pick up other languages and nuances such as Ruby or advanced C quickly and be put to good use as soon as possible. </p>

				<br>

						"Kevin ... worked on a system for helping with internal testing, interfacing with various sets of hardware and writing algorithms based on data received from said hardware. He jumped right into the challenge, learning the project background quickly, and contributed significantly to the success of the project ... The work resulted in a technology concept which will add to the patent portfolio at Ivani. Kevin’s natural intelligence and commitment to the company were evident throughout the summer. He naturally adapted to our culture, while impacting it in a positive way. Having Kevin work with us for the summer was awesome, and I would not hesitate in recommending him to future employers."

				<br>

				<p>Most recently, I have worked for Ivani, a startup company in Missouri that specializes in sensor technology and home automation. In the past, I have worked as a Treasury Intern for Boxer Property Management Corporation and have done research at University of Texas on zebrafish and optic proteins. I have also collaborated on side projects such as recreating the popular mobile app game '2048'. Presently, I am involved in a multitude of activities at Olin, such as Electrical Vehicles, Aquaponics, and Robotics. I also actively compete in Hackathons and continue to work on side projects, such as learning graphic design, exploring web development, and building a personal electric GoKart to drive to the dining hall.  </p>


				<p>For fun, I like to explore various cool events around campus, such as Co-Curriculars, fun no credit classes where professors teach others about their hobbies, such as pottery or fermentation. In my free time, I enjoy playing frisbee and tennis, listening to music, learning new things about software and robots, cooking, hanging out with friends, and daydreaming about chickens (they're kind of my thing :P).</p>

								<p class="item-intro text-muted">Summer 2016</p>

									<p> An basic visual of the technology my team created </p>
								</div>

								<p class="content-body">Ivani is a start up whose presence sensing technology is revolutionary work that aims to change the home automation industry. In contrast to most current technologies that use basic sensors to detect motion or object recognition to activate lights or appliances, Ivani's technology aims to detect a person's physical being within a room, thus creating a smarter and more accurate system. As a college freshman, Ivani took a chance on me as a student with comparatively less experience but equipped with a wide array of skills and a bright motivation to learn and make an impact, and I seized the opportunity and delivered.</p>

								<p class="content-body">Teamed up with fellow Oliner Liani Lye, I was assigned the task of creating a testing module for the company's original presence sensing system, with the idea being to train the original. We went further than that and ended up developing a brand new patent-pending presence sensing technology that not only trained the original system but could also act as a stand alone presence detector. The technology we created could not only detect a person's physical presence, but could also determine where the person is in reference to the detection field, such as how far away they were, whether they were approaching the room or moving away, etc. Our team was well organized with weekly sprints and check-ins with each other and our supervisor, constant communication and pair programming, as well as occasional personal conversation on how we were feeling about the team and our work to make sure that our team was always performing at its best. Because we were trying to create something that had never been done before, we used a very systematic approach, first performing many tests and experiments to understand more about the system, then breaking down the problem into smaller portions that we would individually tackle, and then eventually re-combining the two pieces using an iterative process, ending with an MVP of the new technology. My role on the team for this project mainly involved designing the software algorithms that we used and optimizing them, as well as writing firmware for sensor hardware. I was also heavily involved in sensor data perception and decision making, trying to understand the data we were seeing as well as mapping out where the user is in context to the detection system. Our creation will streamline further development of the full-timers main presence sensing technology and expand the company's repertoire of presence sensing capabilities. </p>

								<p class="content-body"> In addition to the main project, Liani and I also thought up a secondary project that we believed could augment the main project we were working on. I personally spearheaded this exploratory venture, and I ended up creating a sensor hardware that integrated additional data streams to improve the output of the main project. The process for this project mirrored that of the main, with experimentation followed by a break up of the main problem into smaller pieces and then re-combining the pieces into a holistic algorithm. I learned how to use a new piece of hardware, process its data with an algorithm I wrote in Arduino bootloader and C++, and interface it with our Python codebase. The augmentation I created stabilized the algorithm and provided more consistent and accurate outputs. Because of the additional sensors I integrated into the system, we also created the framework for the ability of the technology to learn trends and statistics, thus being able to predict the pathway that a user will most likely take in a home and optimize lighting or other appliances.   </p>

								<p class="content-body"> The technology we were creating was so new that we eventually realized that it could be patented. We contributed to a patent application on the new technology we had created, effectively bolstering company assets. The patent is currently being submitted and is in progress for filing. </p>

								<p class="content-body"> Besides the main projects I worked on, I also took initiative to take on several smaller quality of life projects not just for my team but also for the company as a whole. I flushed out a modular code architecture for future software development that increased code readability and organization and also provided easier transitions for when a new hardware was acquired or a new codebase was being started. The framework compartmentalized the presence sensing process into three main parts, and outlined general methods that all processes should use. The architecture was actually implemented in our team codebase and made both communication and debugging much more efficient. I also laid the foundations for test-driven development by conceptualizing a unit testing system that allowed for more optimized development. I not only designed a robust unit testing process but also wrote a comprehensive guide to allow the full timers to learn about the system on their own time. While the system isn't currently being used because the company is still small enough such that direct communication is faster, the company definitely believes that it will come into use once the company grows further and a more organized system will be needed. Finally, I helped characterize test inputs for system development, running various experiments to help the company better understand the data they were reading. I actually came to several conclusions that gave the full-timers many new things to consider moving forward, such as trends in the data and previously unknown traits that occasionally will be exhibited under certain conditions. Using data analytics, I ended up finding a flaw in the current microcontroller the company was using and confirmed the need to switch to a new microcontroller, which was two times faster and much more consistent. </p>

								<p class="content-body"> Overall, the Summer of 2016 has been the most fun, most educational, and most accomplished summer I've ever had. I believe that both Ivani and I have benefitted greatly from this experience, and I can't wait to see what's next, for me and Ivani. </p>

								<p class="content-body">During 2014-2015, my entire senior year at William P. Clements High School, I worked as a research intern at UT Health at the Medical Center in Houston. I was looking into the visual sciences, specifically examining proteins within the eye and how they all connected together to form the massive network that allows humans to see. Under the direction of Dr. O'Brien, I experimenting on zebrafish eyes to determine co-localization and possible coupling mechanisms involved in the proteins in their eyes. I gained many useful skills for the lab, including cryosectioning, immunostaining, and high-end microscopy. I also learned more about opthamology and about scientific research in a profressional laboratory. The internship concluded with a presentation of my work to lab associates and officials. Ultimately, my results help the department secure a grant for further research. </p>

								<p class="content-body">		In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined the school's Robotics Lab, eager to learn more about robots and how they worked. I decided to work with the lab's head programmer, Sophia Li, on Edwin, a robotic arm. Our objective was to program Edwin to respond to certain stimuli and interact with users with poses and gestures. Coding was done in Python, and ROS was used as the bridge between Python and Edwin. I mainly focused on creating motion algorithms that Edwin would use to respond to certain signals from the user. At the Olin Expo, we presented our semester's work, which culminated in Edwin playing Tic-Tac-Toe against himself. Our presentation went really well, and many were fascinated in our robot's ability to draw the grid and shapes so accurately.</p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, we took things a step further, working to synthesize a comprehensive and realistic interaction sequence, where people can talk to and play with Edwin as if he were a real live “dinosaur”. This time I took on a larger role, working closely with Sophia to plan out and create interactions and behaviors. I was involved in a lot more projects this time. First I decided that a moving jaw was better than a slack jaw, so I scrounged up a servo and managed to write a modular program in C++ for an Arbotix board that would allow us to control Edwin's lower jaw. I also spent quite a bit of time figuring out touch sensitivity. One thing we thought would be really cool was if Edwin could react to touch. I worked on programming an accelerometer in C++ not only how to recognize when it's being touched but also to differentiate between a pat and a slap. After all this hardware work, I partnered up with Sophie to connect all the pieces together by creating a "brain" module where all information was fed to and where all actions were executed in response to stimuli. Finally after we had finalized the interaction sequences, my last job of the semester was to generate all the motion behavior algorithms that would be used in the interactions. Overall, I wrote almost 50 different behaviors for Edwin. Once again, we presented our work at EXPO, and Edwin dominated by beating people left and right at Tic-Tac-Toe. But challengers continued to arrive, and our table was crowded as people were amazed by Edwin's almost "human-like" behaviors. </p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined a team of individuals that embarked on an extension of the original "Olin Workshop on the Library", a remodeling of the library to include a giant aquaponics aquarium. Aquaponics is like sustainable hydroponics, where marine and plants live in a symbiotic relationship of sustainable growth. The plan is to eventually incorporate this idea into the library. Our first step was to build a small operating aquaponics system to prove feasibility. I was mainly involved in the electrial portion of the project, designing and creating the relay system, monitor system, pumps, and lights. We presented the result of a semester's worth of work at the Olin Expo, where we demonstrated a functional system. Students and faculty alike were excited at our progress and looking forward to our efforts next semester.</p>


								<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, there was a transition of leadership, as the original seniors who started the club appointed a friend Nick and me as the new leaders of the club. After figuring things out, we officially began in the middle of the semester. Our work this semester consisted mainly of turning our "functional" system from last semester into a polished, professional aquaponics system. This mainly involved designing and building a cabinet around the metal frame, improving the water works and pipelines, and ensuring ecological success with the plants and the nurtients. I was working all three portions of the project, as well as coordinating with the team for meeting times, and talking to faculty and the library for support and sponsorship. In the end we managed to create a complete Aquaponics Cabinet with healthy, fast-growing basil. We presented our system at EXPO again, and this time was met with even more of a crowd and praise. We were even approached by neighboring schools and Olin faculty about the possiblities of working together or sponsorships, such as the Charles River Center's Horticulture Program. As the new co-president of the team starting next semeser, I'm eager to see what we can do in the Fall.</p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, in our Software Design class, our final mini project was to create an interactive program of your choosing. My partner, Daniel Daugherty, and I decided to make a game. Daniel wanted to do a shooting game, and I wanted to try out making something like a side-scrolling game. And god bless his soul when Daniel accepted my idea of making the main character a chicken. Thus the game Cap'n Chicken was born. The premise of the game is that a chicken is falling through the sky in an attempt to escape his farm, and he must either dodge or shoot eggs at attacking hawks to last as long as he can. We progressed through the project mainly with paired programming, but we did assign tasks individually. I worked mainly on the mechanics of the game, such as shooting, vertical scrolling, the enemy hawk computer algorithms, the chicken controls, scoring, and game play balancing. Daniel did a lot of the graphics and animations, such as the hawks, the chicken, the home screen background, the eggs, and the clouds and mountains to give a realistic feel of falling through the air. Together we tested each other's code and caught a of lot of bugs for each other. We also had a lot of fun trying to beat each other's high score. When we presented our game at the class exhibition, it was a huge hit. We had several people get really competitive and had to open a second computer with the program on it so that people could play at the same time and see who lasted longer. In the end, I was the one with the highest score, after a close battle with a friend named Jeremy. A lot of people loved our game, and several even suggested turning it into an app of some sort, because they would definitely play it. We plan on doing that in the near future.</p>

My partner and I decided to create an ultrasound range finder that would spin in a circle and then process the distance points it found to produce a bird's eye view of its surroundings. The range finder was built with a breadboard and circuitry, then attached to a motor on a mount. It was connected to an arduino that would receive the data and send it to a third-party processing program that would then plot the points on an axis in real time. I worked mainly on programming the Arduino and third-party processor and integrating the Arduino into the range finder/motor apparatus that my partner built. Come demonstration day, we showed our project to the class, and were met with astounding praise. </p>

								<p class="content-body">Also in November 2015, I attended my second hackathon at Codestellation in Brandeis. Inspired by a friend who once texted on her phone and walked straight into a wall on her way to class, my team decided to build a smart LED that could change color depending on the content of received messages. The theory was that this smart LED would allow cell phone owners to know what messages might be about beforehand and reduce time spenting looking at texts. For the purposes of the hackathon, we evaluated messages on Twitter based on a positivity standard. The project combined Python Twitter API, machine learning, Arduino, and cross platform integration. When a message was sent on Twitter containing a certain hashtag, a python script would catch it and run it through a machine learning program that generated a number based on posivitiy. This number would then be beamed to the Serial Port of an Arduino in C++, where it would be processed to make an LED shine a specific color. I was involved in all parts of the project, mainly spearheading the Arduino portion and cross platform integration bewteen Python and C++, and helping out on machine learning. Our project won the award for Most Challenging Hack.</p>

Clements High School, I collaborated with two friends to take on the challenge of recreating the popular mobile app game "2048" in Java. Having taken 4 years of formal Java training class at Clements, I felt it was time to test my skills. The game was expanded to not only recreate the original mode, but also include a beginner's mode and a two player mode where competitiors could race to reach 512 first. I was mainly involved with coding the homepage screen, the two-player mode, and the original mode. We utilized many things we learned previously but also learned many new concepts such as Mouse and Keyboard Listener, JPanels, basic animations and complex matrices. On the last week of school, we presented our project to the computer science class, and the students loved it. Some were even requesting copies that they could take home. </p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, for our final project in Software Design, we were given 6 weeks to make something "cool". Once again, I partnered up with my friend Daniel Daugherty, but we also teamed up with our other friends Cedric Kim and Kevin Guo. After a long discussion, we managed to fuse together all our interests into a single idea: we were going to create an augmented reality goggle set that would allow users to see their CAD models in real life before even having to fabricate. The idea is that software designers can easily test things by writing up some code and pushing a button, but for mechnanical and electrical engineers testing is a rigorous process of trial and error, constantly building and re-building. Our goggles would level the playing field by providing the ability to test out CAD models in 3D space and rapidly prototype efficiently.</p>

								 <p class="content-body">The teachers were very concerned with our project when we presented the idea to them, as they didn't think it was possible within 6 weeks. But we said "YOLO" and went with it anyways. We split the project into two main portions, to be split among the two pairs: Daniel and I would work on the 3D graphics portions with OpenGL and figure out how to render a CAD model given an .stl file in the real world at some arbitrary point, and Cedric and Kevin Guo would work on tracking and orientation such that our 3D render would be grounded to a specific point and would look like it was really there on the table. To make it within the 6 week timeframe, we made several clever design decisions to circumvent of the most time-consuming portions. To make the program work like virtual reality, we created two fullscreen windows of our program with stereoscopic vision, and then used a pre-made mobile app that would project our PC screen onto a phone, which could then be used in a Google Cardboard. We also strapped a webcam to the Google Cardboard such that the person could move around on their own and make it seem more real. To simplify the tracking, we utilized a blue checkered piece of cardboard that was easily recognizable. The piece would be tracked by color and then really complicated "Quadrant Math" would be used to find the positions of the four corners, which would tell position, orientation, and depth. On the 3D graphics side, Daniel and I did this completely using paired-programming. We had a huge challenge in rendering a cube; in fact it took us half the time just make a cube appear in our webcam frame. After that, though, we understood everything and continued to blast through the rest of the graphics. I managed to figure out how to render CAD models, and Daniel figured out shading, such that the model looked real. After that, we pulled an all-nighter to integrate the two halves together. We completed the project at 8:05 AM the day it was due.</p>

								 <p class="content-body">When we presented at Olin EXPO, there were a lot of "Wow's" and "Ooo's" and "Ahh's". Many people were impressed by our project, and we were even approached by an MIT representative and invited to present our work at an Inventor's competition at MIT. People said we couldn't do it, and sure it was super hard and a very, very long journey, but the end result was so cool that nothing else mattered except that we had succeeded. Special shoutouts go to Cedric Kim for keeping our spirits high when we hit roadblocks, and Daniel Daugherty for sticking it out with me when we got stuck and for keeping me awake throughout the all-nighter.</p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined REVO due to my love of electrical vehicles. This was the first year that we were going to transition from "research" to "competition", so I was excited to get in on the action. The team was designing a Formula electrical racing car that would be ready for competition by the Summer of 2016. I mainly worked on the Electrical and Programming Team, designing and coding CAN, our digital data transmission bus that links together and distributes information across the car. Specifically, I worked on CAN regarding the dashboard, Watchdog, and throttle sensing. We presented our work so far at the Olin Expo, having finished the design portion, and ready for the fabrication portion next semester.</p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, we began fabrication, and I continued to work on CAN nodes for the car. As deadlines began appearing on the horizon, the entire Programming team was put into Electrical. I worked on Charging and IMD, as well as PCB boards for the Atmegas that CAN would be programmed into. I also helped with fabrication of the electrical portions, such as soldering boards and testing already fabricated pieces. In the end, I was unable to attend the competition myself due to schedule conflicts, but apparently we did pretty well for a first year competition team, placing 2nd in Design and 7th overall.</p>

								<p class="content-body">While I am proud of the work that I've done with the team, my feelings towards REVO have begun to change. I originally thought of REVO as a place to learn more about electrical vehicles, but now I feel it's more just about how to build a car for competition. Whether that's something I'm still interested in, I'm not entirely sure yet. Only time will tell.</p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, during the second half of my Design Nature class, we were told to build a bio-inspired game that would entertain 4th graders. The only premises were that we were limited to a set budget of $100, and the game should embody the animal that we chose. Our team chose the Bald Eagle, and we built our game to model the swooping and feeding behaviors of the eagle. We designed an Eagle Costume meant to provide a full-body experience, and our game was unique from others in that it was a two-stage game, the first for swooping down and grabbing fish, and the second for throwing fish into your partner's "Eagle Head" hat. For the final demonstration, real 4th graders visited Olin and came to play our games. Our play experience went extremely well, with a good number of children telling us upfront that our game was their favorite. </p>

								<p class="content-body">In November 2015, I attended my first hackathon at HackHolyoke. Having been at Olin for a while, I was dissatisfied with the college's bike rental system, where the sole means of "rental" was a clipboard hanging from the ceiling. With a team that was formed onsite, we developed a web app that put Olin's bike rental system on the internet. The web app could manage and monitor all the bikes allowed for rental, giving user-friendly access to checkouts, checkins, reservations, and problem reports. The app was made using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. I wrote all of the back-end that required HTML5 and Javascript, and the my teammates styled everything with CSS. Our team won 4th place best Hack overall, and 2nd place for Most Societally Beneficial Hack. As my first year came to an end, I worked with the Olin faculty and managed to make our protype website a reality. Now Olin has an online website that manages codes and keeps track of bikes all from the internet. It was really cool seeing my work paving the way for a new change at my college.</p>

								<p class="content-body">During my four years at William P. Clements High School from 2011-2015, I was part of the MAO Math Club at our school. I participated in every meeting and practiced for competitions, but I always felt that communication between members and officers was lacking, and our member attendace was dropping over the years. When I became Webmaster my senior year, I revamped the club website, improving user-interface and accessibility. Members became more aware of the various opportunities to volunteer and compete, as well as more informed about the club's activities. I also worked with the other officers and paved the way for the founding of what is now known as MNHS - MAO National Honor Society. MAO became a dual club, one for the original competition club, and the other which held members who liked math and wanted to meet and discuss cool math topics but didn't want to deal with competitive pressure. MAO has now become an intellectual hub at Clements, with over 100 members and rising.</p>

In 2014, I became Artistic Director and was responsible for the cultural decorations for the festival. I helped design giant murals that marked the greatest cultural mythologies of the world and then managed decoration sessions to create and paint these giant murals. I also introduced new ideas to the festival such as cultural games and art galleries to showcase artifacts from around the world. The decorations committee finished a month early ahead of schedule, and then went on the make more decorations beyond the original standard. The International Festival that year was record-breaking and was our largest attendance to date.</p>

I debated competitively for 4 years, qualifying two times for the Debate TFA State Tournament, and once making it into the Texas Top 50. I was also once crowned Debate MVP of my team in 2011. During my time with the club, I volunteered to help create a website that would help with communication, information posting, and document distribution among members. This was the first website I ever made. In my final year, I passed down my skills to underclassmen by running workshops and teaching novices how to debate.</p>
