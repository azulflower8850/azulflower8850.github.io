				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>I am sophomore at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, majoring in Computational Robotics Engineering with a concentration in Computer Science. It's a self-made major that combines the technology and expanding field of robotics with the knowledge and approach of computer science. I am deeply passionate about both software and robots, and as a growing boy hungry for knowledge, I just couldn't say no to either one!</p>

				<p>As my major suggests, I do have an extensive software background. I have taken 4 years of formal training in Java programming, and I have also taken 2 years of college level courses in Python. In addition, I have self-taught myself C++, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and some C, PHP, and SQL. I am also an extremely fast learner: I learned both HTML5 and JavaScript to a proficient level in about a week each, so I am confident that I can pick up other languages and nuances such as Ruby or more advanced C quickly and be put to good use as soon as possible. </p>

						"Kevin ... worked on a system for helping with internal testing, interfacing with various sets of hardware and writing algorithms based on data received from said hardware. He jumped right into the challenge, learning the project background quickly, and contributed significantly to the success of the project ... The work resulted in a technology concept which will add to the patent portfolio at Ivani. Kevin’s natural intelligence and commitment to the company were evident throughout the summer. He naturally adapted to our culture, while impacting it in a positive way. Having Kevin work with us for the summer was awesome, and I would not hesitate in recommending him to future employers."

				<br>
				<br>

				<p>Most recently, I have worked for Ivani, a startup company in Missouri that specializes in network presence sensing technology and home automation. There, I interned as a Software Development Engineer and exceeded project expectations to patent a new presence sensing technology. In the past, I have worked as a Treasury Intern for Boxer Property Management Corporation and have done research at University of Texas on zebrafish and optic proteins. I have also collaborated on side projects such as building a robotic MIDI keyboard. Presently, I am involved in a multitude of activities at Olin, such as Computer Security, Aquaponics, and Robotics. I also actively compete in Hackathons and continue to work on side projects, such as learning graphic design, creating my own Jarvis assistant, and building a personal electric GoKart to drive to the dining hall.  </p>


				<p>For fun, I like to explore various cool events around campus, such as Co-Curriculars, fun no credit classes where professors teach others about their hobbies, which include pottery and fermentation. In my free time, I enjoy playing frisbee and tennis, listening to music, exploring more about software and robots, cooking, hanging out with friends, and daydreaming about chickens (they're kind of my thing :P).</p>

								<p class="content-body">Ivani is a start up working on revolutionary network presence sensing technology that allows wireless communication systems to observe RF disturbances without the addition of new hardware. It then analyzes these disturbances to determine the physical occupancy of a person inside a room. As a college freshman, Ivani took a chance on me as a student with comparatively less experience but equipped with a wide array of skills and a bright motivation to learn and make an impact, and I seized the opportunity to deliver. </p>

								<p class="content-body">Teamed up with fellow Oliner Liani Lye, I was assigned the task of creating a testing module for the company's original presence sensing system, with the idea being to train the original. We exceeded the project goals and ended up developing a brand new patent-pending presence sensing technology that not only trained the original system but could also act as a stand alone presence detector. The technology we created could both detect a person's physical presence, and also determine where the person is in reference to the detection field, such as how far away they were, whether they were approaching the room or moving away, etc. What's special about the technology is that it doesn't require any new hardware; all nodes of the system can come from off-the-shelf hardware that most households already possess. This makes our technology both extremely modular and easily integrated into existing systems. Our team was well organized with weekly sprints and check-ins with each other and our supervisor, constant communication and pair programming, as well as occasional personal conversation to ensure best performance from the team. Because we were trying to create something that had never been done before, we used a very systematic approach, first performing many tests and experiments to understand more about the system, then breaking down the problem into smaller portions that we would individually tackle, and then eventually re-combining the pieces using an iterative process. My role on the team for this project mainly involved designing the software algorithms that we used and optimizing them, as well as writing firmware for sensor hardware. I was also heavily involved in sensor data perception and decision making, trying to understand the data we were seeing as well as mapping out where the user is in context to the detection system. We ended with an MVP that interfaced with a Raspberry Pi and created a network of sensors on the user, in rooms, and in the hallways. It could determine presence, relative location of the user to a room, and real time movements of the said user. Our creation will streamline further development of the full-timers main presence sensing technology and expand the company's repertoire of presence sensing capabilities. Our work paved the way for Ivani's next projects in the pipeline, People Counting and People Locating.</p>

								<p class="content-body"> In addition to the main project, Liani and I also thought up a secondary project that we believed could augment the main project we were working on. I personally spearheaded this exploratory venture, and I ended up creating a sensor construct that integrated additional data streams to improve the output of the main project. The process for this project mirrored that of the main, with experimentation followed by a break up of the main problem into smaller pieces and then re-combining the pieces into a holistic algorithm. The augmentation I created stabilized the main algorithm and provided more consistent and accurate outputs. Because of the additional sensors I integrated into the system, we also created the framework for the ability of the technology to learn trends and statistics, thus being able to predict the pathway that a user will most likely take in a home and optimize lighting or other appliances. The construct I added to the original project ended up increasing accuracy of outputs and predictions by about 40%, thus significantly adding to the system's performance.  </p>

								<p class="content-body"> The technology we were creating was so new that we eventually realized that it could be patented. We contributed to a patent application on the new technology we had created, effectively bolstering company assets. The patent, <i>Reverse-Beacon Indoor Positioning System Using Existing Detection Fields</i>, is currently submitted and is in progress for filing. The company estimates that the patent will be worth at least $300,000 once it's completely filed and being utilized.</p>

								<p class="content-body"> Besides the main projects I worked on, I also took initiative to take on several smaller quality of life projects not just for my team but also for the company as a whole. I flushed out a modular code architecture for future software development that increased code readability and organization and also provided easier transitions for when a new hardware was acquired or a new codebase was being started. The framework compartmentalized the presence sensing process into three main parts, and outlined general methods that all processes should use. The architecture was actually implemented in our team codebase and made both communication and debugging much more efficient. I also laid the foundations for test-driven development by conceptualizing a unit testing system that allowed for more optimized development. I not only designed a robust unit testing process but also wrote a comprehensive guide to allow the full timers to learn about the system on their own time. While the system isn't currently being used because the company is still small enough such that direct communication is faster, the company definitely believes that it will come into use once the company grows further and a more organized system will be needed. Finally, I helped characterize test inputs for system development, running various experiments to help the company better understand the data they were reading. I actually came to several conclusions that gave the full-timers many new things to consider moving forward, such as trends in the data and previously unknown traits that occasionally will be exhibited under certain conditions. Using data analytics, I ended up finding a flaw in the current microcontroller the company was using and confirmed the need to switch to a new microcontroller, which was two times faster and much more consistent. </p>

								<p class="content-body"> Overall, the Summer of 2016 has been the most fun, most educational, and most accomplished summer I've ever had. I believe that both Ivani and I have benefitted greatly from this experience, and I can't wait to see what's next, for me and Ivani. </p>

I was looking into the visual sciences, specifically examining proteins within the eye and how they all connected together to form the massive network that allows humans to see. Under the direction of Dr. O'Brien, I experimenting on zebrafish eyes to determine co-localization and possible coupling mechanisms involved in the proteins in their eyes. I gained many useful skills for the lab, including cryosectioning, immunostaining, and high-end microscopy. I also learned more about opthamology and about scientific research in a profressional laboratory. The internship concluded with a presentation of my work to lab associates and officials. Ultimately, my results help the department secure a grant for further research. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In October of 2016, I teamed up with friends Cedric Kim, Daniel Daugherty, Kevin Guo, and Jeremy Garcia under the name Stark Industries to design and build an autonomous snowball launcher. With winter coming up in Boston and weather forecasts predicting a bountiful snow season this year, we wanted to collaborate and put our skill sets together to create the ultimate weapon in snowball fights. We noticed from last year's snowball fights that we were really bad at hitting the opposing team, and getting wet in the cold from snow falling into our clothes wasn't fun. We wanted to build a robot that could dominate snowball fights, with bullseye accuracy and strong defense against snow. The original concept was a completely autonomous snowball launcher that could find, track, and shoot targets all on its own. To make some tangible goals, we set forth a number of specifications that we wanted this robot to have: it would be able to shoot up to 40 feet away, be able to automatically arm and re-arm itself within 6 seconds, find and lock on targets without any user input and fire more accurately than a human, and be able to handle the entire snowball shooting sequence from packing a snowball to firing it by itself. We named this robot Frost. </p>

							<p class="content-body">To build Frost, we decided to split up into subteams to tackle the individual components. Jeremy and I would take on software, and Cedric, Daniel, and Kevin would take on mechanical. Due to a lack of a strong electrical engineer, we decided that we would all pitch in for any electrical portions, of which there were few. We split up the project into four two-week sprints, with goals to meet each sprint. On the software side, Jeremy wasn't open to the idea of pair programming, so we decided to just split work and combine codebases when necessary. Cedric and I took informal leadership roles in governing our subteams as well as planning out next steps and weekly goals. Due to schedule conflicts, we decided that each member would be responsible on their own for finishing their portion of that week's goal, and as close friends, we trusted each other to do so. With this team set up, we managed to complete the project in under 8 weeks. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the First Sprint, we decided to first create a proof of concept that such a robot was physically possible, as there were no online sources to check its feasibility. Our goal was to create a prototype, a miniature version of the real robot that could be manually controlled to make sure that it was possible for a robot to shoot towards a target location. On the software team, our main goal for this sprint was to write the firmware for the Arduino that controlled the motors to actuate the catapult and turn the pan control. I worked mainly on getting the firmware logic to work with panning towards a specific direction, arming, firing a set distance, and then re-arming. Jeremy created a basic interface so that we could easily manipulate various variables to test out our catapult prototype. By the end of the sprint, we were able put together a prototype of Frost, complete with a fabricated catapult and armed with manual control of the pan and the firing arm. I managed to streamline the firing sequence such that we met our goal of arming, firing, and re-arming in under 6 seconds. We tested the catapult in multiple different experiments and confirmed that it was indeed possible to create Frost. It was feasible to create an autonomous snowball launcher. We were on a roll. </p>

							<p class="content-body">For the Second Sprint, our goals became a little too ambitious. We wanted to push our limits and see how far we could get, so we decided to take on multiple different goals at once. We wanted to create all the intelligent and autonomous parts of Frost. Mechanical decided to try and build our own LIDAR and create a compactor mechanism for packing snowballs, and software decided to try and get autonomous finding and tracking down. For this sprint, I worked mainly on interfacing with a Kinect camera and getting computer vision to work with our prototype as well as helping out with interfacing with the LIDAR, and Jeremy worked mainly on experimenting with various methods to try to find and track a human in a camera's field of view. Jeremy found out that motion detection was a viable option, but we soon discovered that when integrated with my computer vision unit on the prototype, the pan motor was too often confused because the outputs were consistent enough. The mechanical team also did not have much luck either. At the end of the sprint, neither subteam was able to reach their goals. We decided to pivot away from a completely autonomous robot and tossed the idea of the compactor. Now the robot was autonomous starting from when a user gives it a packed snowball. We treated this sprint as a significant learning experience about proper scoping and understanding our limits. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Third Sprint, we kept our same goal as before to finish adding autonomy to Frost, but this time with renewed vigor. I joined Jeremy in experimenting and developing finding and tracking targets. I discovered a robust method through body detection that used machine learning to search for the contours of a human body, and together Jeremy and I worked on developing this method. We managed to bring accuracy of detecting a human body up to over 90%, and I optimized the algorithm to ensure constant, consistent output so that the actuators would always know where to go. I worked with Cedric on the LIDAR, mainly in integrating it with the data from the body detection module. I also created a multiprocessing code arhcitecture to allow for smooth and fast integration of the two data streams, and wrote out the decision making algorithm that told Frost where to point and how far to shoot. By the end of the third sprint, we had successfully created an intelligent version of Frost, capable of finding targets on its own and firing towards them with a successful hit percentage of about 80%. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Fourth and Final Sprint, it was the home stretch, and our goal was to finish building the final robot and integrate all our intelligence on the final version. For the software team, this meant optimizing the LIDAR, body detection, and integration modules and making sure they were perfect. I took on the task of optimizing the software modules, and Jeremy decided to create a nice website to document our work. I managed to stabilize LIDAR output such that it was more consistent. I also managed to optimize the body detection module to detect and track bodies almost 100% of the time, with constant output. Finally, I improved the integration and decision making algorithms such that Frost's firing accuracy was 98%, always shooting within 6 inches of the target's center, which is almost a guaranteed hit. Since I finished early, I decided to experiment with a Raspiberry Pi, as having our codebase running on a Pi would make Frost more mobile. I discovered that the two Arduinos, a Kinect, and a LIDAR was too much for the Raspi and caused it to overheat to excessive current draw, so unforunately the side project was closed. After that, I worked with the team to finish the catapult. We finished fabricating and assembling our final catapult, which was bigger, made of metal, and much stronger than the prototype. We also remade our circuit boards and other electrical components to accommodate for the new robot. With the finished Mechanical, Software, and Electrical components ready, we finished our project by integrating all the parts together and improving the final product until it was ready. </p>

							<p class="content-body"> Come Olin EXPO, we showcased Frost to the community and let guests have a test run with getting found and shot at by Frost. Unfortunately, there was no snow that day, so we settled with a plushy toy. Even then, the crowd was blown away by our work, and many people wanted multiple turns. After some documentation and publicity work, we have completed our work with Frost - the Autonomous Snowball Launcher. Come next semester, when the snow begins to fall, the people who once gaped in amazement will soon run in fear as we return from winter break to dominate the snowball game. </p>

							<p class="content-body">		In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined the school's Robotics Lab, eager to learn more about robots and how they worked. I decided to work with the lab's head programmer, Sophia Li, on Edwin, a robotic arm. Our objective was to program Edwin to respond to certain stimuli and interact with users with poses and gestures. Coding was done in Python, and ROS was used as the bridge between Python and Edwin. I mainly focused on creating motion algorithms that Edwin would use to respond to certain signals from the user. At the Olin Expo, we presented our semester's work, which culminated in Edwin playing Tic-Tac-Toe against himself. Our presentation went really well, and many were fascinated in our robot's ability to draw the grid and shapes so accurately.</p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, we took things a step further, working to synthesize a comprehensive and realistic interaction sequence, where people can talk to and play with Edwin as if he were a real live “dinosaur”. This time I took on a larger role, working closely with Sophia to plan out and create interactions and behaviors. I was involved in a lot more projects this time. First I decided that a moving jaw was better than a slack jaw, so I scrounged up a servo and managed to write a modular program in C++ for an Arbotix board that would allow us to control Edwin's lower jaw. I also spent quite a bit of time figuring out touch sensitivity. One thing we thought would be really cool was if Edwin could react to touch. I worked on programming an accelerometer in C++ not only how to recognize when it's being touched but also to differentiate between a pat and a slap. After all this hardware work, I partnered up with Sophie to connect all the pieces together by creating a "brain" module where all information was fed to and where all actions were executed in response to stimuli. Finally after we had finalized the interaction sequences, my last job of the semester was to generate all the motion behavior algorithms that would be used in the interactions. Overall, I wrote almost 50 different behaviors for Edwin. Once again, we presented our work at EXPO, and Edwin dominated by beating people left and right at Tic-Tac-Toe. But challengers continued to arrive, and our table was crowded as people were amazed by Edwin's almost "human-like" behaviors. </p>

								<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2016, I decided to borrow some concepts from my internship at Ivani during the past summer. My goal was to accomplish presence detection, or give Edwin the ability to detect the physical body of users inside a room and follow them around or create playful interactions, such as responding to hand waves. I worked a lot in C++ in addition to Python this semester, and I delved heavily into APIs, computer vision, algorithms, and machine learning. To start, I did a lot of research into Cmakelists and experimenting with the sample code, and I was able to get the Kinect Nite API working on Edwin's system by figuring out the right protocols and dependencies needed to interface between C++ and ROS. I then wrote Python scripts to communicate to my C++ scripts via rostopics and wrote various data structures and algorithms to keep track of and remember bodies. In this way, I developed a script that could tell when a new body had been detected by the Kinect. Interfacing it with motions from Edwin's behavior repertoire, I was able to make Edwin physically respond to when a person enters his field of vision, creating presence detection. Then I added the capability of Edwin to differentiate between different bodies, so it could tell who was who. I further developed the code to keep track of coordinates, and using tf transforms in ROS and measured transformations between rotating reference frames from the Kinect to Edwin's coordinate system, I was able to write another algorithm that gave Edwin coordinates to move to in response to the location of the person of interest, defined as the person closest to Edwin. This then gave Edwin the ability to follow users around a room, as the algorithms could calculate where the user was and then send that as set points for Edwin to move to. I also able to incorporate machine learning and developing it such that Edwin could detect and keep track of a person's hand. I developed this module to the point where Edwin can detect when a person waves his hand by keeping track of the hand's position and searching for a repetitive sweeping motion, and then respond with a behavior. Finally, I integrated these two pieces into one interaction sequence, where an approaching user will prompt Edwin to greet them and then begin following them, and when that user waves, Edwin will respond happily. The interaction sequence can then be toggled on and off to allow lead into other sequences or follow people while idle. Overall, I met pretty much all the goals I had planned out for this semester. When we presented Edwin at EXPO, people were wow'ed by Edwin's ability to recognize hand waves, and many were very impressed by Edwin's "intelligence", as my presence detection module which was incorporated in between all the other projects by other members of the team made him feel personal and alive. </p>

								<p class="content=body">My work and partnership with close friend Sophia Li has given me the opportunity to succeed her role once she graduates as Research Project Lead of Edwin. I plan on filling her shoes and continuing developing Edwin to become the best coworker there ever was.</p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, for our final project in Software Design, we were given 6 weeks to make something "cool". Once again, I partnered up with my friend Daniel Daugherty, but we also teamed up with our other friends Cedric Kim and Kevin Guo. After a long discussion, we managed to fuse together all our interests into a single idea: we were going to create an augmented reality goggle set that would allow users to see their CAD models in real life before even having to fabricate. The idea is that software designers can easily test things by writing up some code and pushing a button, but for mechnanical and electrical engineers testing is a rigorous process of trial and error, constantly building and re-building. Our goggles would level the playing field by providing the ability to test out CAD models in 3D space and rapidly prototype efficiently.</p>

							 <p class="content-body">The teachers were very concerned with our project when we presented the idea to them, as they didn't think it was possible within 6 weeks. But we said "YOLO" and went with it anyways. We split the project into two main portions, to be split among the two pairs: Daniel and I would work on the 3D graphics portions with OpenGL and figure out how to render a CAD model given an .stl file in the real world at some arbitrary point, and Cedric and Kevin Guo would work on tracking and orientation such that our 3D render would be grounded to a specific point and would look like it was really there on the table. To make it within the 6 week timeframe, we made several clever design decisions to circumvent of the most time-consuming portions. To make the program work like virtual reality, we created two fullscreen windows of our program and calculated their distance apart to create stereoscopic vision, and then used a pre-made mobile app that would project our PC screen onto a phone, which could then be used in a Google Cardboard. We also strapped a webcam to the Google Cardboard such that the person could move around on their own and make it seem more real. To simplify the tracking, we utilized a blue checkered piece of cardboard that was easily recognizable. The piece would be tracked by color and then really complicated "Quadrant Math" would be used to find the positions of the four corners, which would tell position, orientation, and depth. On the 3D graphics side, Daniel and I did this completely using paired-programming. We encountered a huge challenge in rendering a cube; in fact it took us half the time just make a cube appear in our webcam frame. After that, though, we understood the library and continued to blast through the rest of the graphics. I managed to figure out how to render CAD models, and Daniel figured out shading, such that the model looked real. We decided to add additional features to make the model interactive, such as zooming in and out of models, changing colors, rotating the model for different views, etc. I also worked on optimizing the rendering software such that the raw-to-processed lag time was only approximiately 100 milliseconds, perfectly acceptable for human usage. After that, we pulled an all-nighter to integrate the two halves together. We completed the project at 8:05 AM the day it was due.</p>

							 <p class="content-body">When we presented at Olin EXPO, there were a lot of "Wow's" and "Ooo's" and "Ahh's". Many people were impressed by our project, and we were even approached by an MIT representative and invited to present our work at an Inventor's conference at MIT. People said we couldn't do it, and sure it was super hard and a very, very long journey, but in the end we had succeeded. Special shoutouts go to Cedric Kim for keeping our spirits high when we hit roadblocks, and Daniel Daugherty for sticking it out with me when we got stuck and for keeping me awake throughout the all-nighter.</p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined a team of individuals that embarked on an extension of the original "Olin Workshop on the Library", a remodeling of the library to include a giant aquaponics aquarium. Aquaponics is like sustainable hydroponics, where marine and plants live in a symbiotic relationship of sustainable growth. The plan is to eventually incorporate this idea into the library. Our first step was to build a small operating aquaponics system to prove feasibility. I was mainly involved in the electrial portion of the project, designing and creating the relay system, monitor system, pumps, and lights. We presented the result of a semester's worth of work at the Olin Expo, where we demonstrated a functional system. Students and faculty alike were excited at our progress and looking forward to our efforts next semester.</p>


							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, there was a transition of leadership, as the original seniors who started the club appointed a friend Nick and me as the new leaders of the club. After figuring things out, we officially began in the middle of the semester. Our work this semester consisted mainly of turning our "functional" system from last semester into a polished, professional aquaponics system. This mainly involved designing and building a cabinet around the metal frame, improving the water works and pipelines, and ensuring ecological success with the plants and the nurtients. I was working all three portions of the project, as well as coordinating with the team for meeting times, and talking to faculty and the library for support and sponsorship. In the end we managed to create a complete Aquaponics Cabinet with healthy, fast-growing basil. Our yield was approximately 1 quart of basil per month. We presented our system at EXPO again, and this time was met with even more of a crowd and praise. We were even approached by neighboring schools and Olin faculty about the possiblities of working together or sponsorships, such as the Charles River Center's Horticulture Program. As the new co-president of the team starting next semeser, I'm eager to see what we can do in the Fall.</p>

							<p class="content-body"> In the Fall of 2016, as the new club co-leader, I managed to negotiate a new system with our new sponsor, the librarian, that would be built into a bookshelf, so that we would have a fully integrated aquaponics system that would exist literally inside the library. Our goal for this semester was to design and start building a functional version of our new system. The new system would be twice as big as the old system, and it would have a fully functional aquarium fit with aqua life, making it a legitimate aquaponics system. Once functional, it would have a yield of about 1 peck per month, and it would use even less energy and require less maintenance than the old system. As co-leader, I handled the high level organizational work, such as talking with sponsors and buying supplies from vendors, handling budget and logistics, and streamlining workflow among the subteams. We managed to attract new members and raise team membership from less than 10 to over 20. On the techincal side, I worked with all subteams, including plumbing, ecological, electrical, and mechanical, making sure that teams were progressing smoothly, ensuring inter-team communication, and solving technical problems that arose in the teams. I was also in charge of maintaining the old system, as we were still growing basil in it. As club leader, I'm making an effort to try and create a new type of club at Olin, where all students have a strong say in the direction of the club, and the progression of the team is predominantly member-driven rather than leader-driven. In this manner I'm acting more as a facilitator of club proceedings rather than ordering members around, and allowing for members to take a more leadership role than they would elsewhere and learn to work together and think for themselves. Due to technical diffculties, we were unable to finish the functional system, although we do have all the components flushed out and built. We presented our work at EXPO again, and this time was met with renewed interest at the possiblity and progress of a "sustainable garden" in the library. Turns out being a leader of a club is tough work, but I'm up to the challenge. We made a lot of progress this semester, and I'm sure that by the end of next semester, we'll have completed the second system. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In November of 2016, I attended HackHolyoke 2016. Teaming with fellow Oliners Eric Miller, Kimberly Winter, and Max Wei, we came up with an idea that incorporated all of our interests: we wanted to create a MIDI keyboard that relied only on a depth sensor and a flat glass surface with key etchings. As we were all musically oriented, we wanted to create a proof of concept of a really modular, cheap alternative to complex, expensive equipment such as a grand piano. Even MIDI keyboards were hundreds of dollars, so we wanted to see if it possible to create one that cost about 50. We named our project PianoPianoRevolution because there was talk of potentially creating a game to go along with the MIDI keyboard, kind of like DanceDanceRevolution where users could practice their piano moves with our portable keyboard, but this side of the project was never fully realized. As the most experienced software developer on the team, I was tasked with Kimberly Winter to interface with an off-the-shelf depth sensor called the Leap Motion and figure out how to utilize it to create a keyboard that could be played. Max and Eric would work on creating the encasing that users would use to play the piano. I managed to interface with the Leap Motion, and then Kimberly discovered that a key can be considered "played" by just striking down with a finger, which could be tracked by the Leap Motion. She found that since the Leap Motion keeps a 3D map of your hands, theoretically you could just play like you were playing a real piano, and as long as your striked key finger is lower than all your other fingers, then you could play a sound for that specific finger depending on where in space it came down. I then worked on making her vision a reality. We worked primarily in Python, and used sensor fusion, Leap Motion and Mingus APIs, and complex algorithms. Kim mapped out the keys in space, and I used her measurements to create a 2D projection of a virtual keyboard, then I wrote out a decision making algorithm to decide when a key was pressed based on the depth of the finger from the Leap Motion, and also what key was pressed based on where the pressed finger was in the 2D projection. Then I worked with Kimberly to incorporate piano sounds into the algorithm. Eric and Max eventually found the right materials and CADed a keyboard, which they laser cut onto a flat glass surface so that it appeared that a keyboard was etched into the glass. We continued to improve the codebase, making it more and more real, such as adding in the ability to hold keys, press more than one key at once, etc., until we ran out of time and the hackathon was over. </p>

							<p class="content-body"> When it was time to present our work to the judges, we had a completed MIDI keyboard ready. The keyboard is fully playable up to two octaves around the middle C key, and users can play scales, chords, and even whole piano pieces. We believe we did create a proof of concept showing that it is indeed possible to use high-end technology to make such affordable instruments, especially with the introduction of precise depth sensors in new smart phones. The judges were amazed by our product and our vision, and they kept coming back to try it out and play small tunes on our keyboard. We ended up winning First Place Best Hack Award for our product. Funnily enough, a new startup on Kickstarter came out with a product called Freedrum, which was basically our product but for drummers, at roughly the same time. It was really cool to both be able to make such an amazing and innovative product, but also see that our vision was shared and being realized by others around the world. Maybe one day in the future I can fully realize this vision as well. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, in our Software Design class, our final mini project was to create an interactive program of our choosing. My partner, Daniel Daugherty, and I decided to make a game. Daniel wanted to do a shooting game, and I wanted to try out making something like a side-scrolling game. And god bless his soul when Daniel accepted my idea of making the main character a chicken. Thus the game Cap'n Chicken was born. The premise of the game is that a chicken is falling through the sky in an attempt to escape his farm, and he must either dodge or shoot eggs at attacking hawks to last as long as he can. We progressed through the project mainly with paired programming, but we did assign tasks individually. I worked mainly on the mechanics of the game, such as shooting, vertical scrolling, the enemy hawk computer algorithms, the chicken controls, scoring, and game play balancing. Daniel did a lot of the graphics and animations, such as the hawks, the chicken, the home screen background, the eggs, and the clouds and mountains to give a realistic feel of falling through the air. Together we tested each other's code and caught a of lot of bugs for each other. We also had a lot of fun trying to beat each other's high score. When we presented our game at the class exhibition, it was a huge hit. We had several people get really competitive and had to open a second computer with the program on it so that people could play at the same time and see who lasted longer. In the end, I was the one with the highest score, after a close battle with a friend named Jeremy. A lot of people loved our game, and several even suggested turning it into an app of some sort, because they would definitely play it. We plan on doing that in the future.</p>

								<p class="content-body">Also in November 2015, I attended my second hackathon at Codestellation in Brandeis. Inspired by a friend who once texted on her phone and walked straight into a wall on her way to class, my team decided to build a smart LED that could change color depending on the content of received messages. The theory was that this smart LED would allow cell phone owners to know what messages might be about beforehand and reduce time spenting looking at texts. For the purposes of the hackathon, we evaluated messages on Twitter based on a positivity standard. The project combined Python Twitter API, machine learning, Arduino, and cross platform integration. When a message was sent on Twitter containing a certain hashtag, a python script would catch it and run it through a machine learning program that generated a number based on posivitiy. This number would then be beamed to the Serial Port of an Arduino in C++, where it would be processed to make an LED shine a specific color. I was involved in all parts of the project, mainly spearheading the Arduino portion and cross platform integration bewteen Python and C++, and helping out on machine learning. Our project won the award for Most Technically Challenging Hack.</p>

							<p class="content-body">In November 2015, I attended my first hackathon at HackHolyoke. Having been at Olin for a while, I was dissatisfied with the college's bike rental system, where the sole means of "rental" was a clipboard hanging from the ceiling. With a team that was formed onsite, we developed a web app that put Olin's bike rental system on the internet. The web app could manage and monitor all the bikes allowed for rental, giving user-friendly access to checkouts, checkins, reservations, and problem reports. The app was made using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. I wrote all of the front-end that required HTML5 and Javascript, and the my teammates styled everything with CSS. Our team won 4th place best Hack overall, and 2nd place for Most Societally Beneficial Hack. As my first year came to an end, I worked with the Olin faculty and managed to make our prototype website a reality. Now Olin has an online website that manages codes and keeps track of bikes all from the internet. It was really cool seeing my work pave the way for a new change at my college.</p>

My partner and I decided to create an ultrasound range finder that would spin in a circle and then process the distance points it found to produce a bird's eye view of its surroundings. The range finder was built with a breadboard and circuitry, then attached to a motor on a mount. It was connected to an arduino that would receive the data and send it to a third-party processing program that would then plot the points on an axis in real time. I worked mainly on programming the Arduino and third-party processor and integrating the Arduino into the range finder/motor apparatus that my partner built. Come demonstration day, we showed our project to the class, and were met with astounding praise. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2015, my final semester at William P. Clements High School, I collaborated with two friends to take on the challenge of recreating the popular mobile app game "2048" in Java. Having taken 4 years of formal Java training class at Clements, I felt it was time to test my skills. The game was expanded to not only recreate the original mode, but also include a beginner's mode and a two player mode where competitiors could race to reach 512 first. I was mainly involved with coding the homepage screen, the two-player mode, and the original mode. We utilized many things we learned previously but also learned many new concepts such as Mouse and Keyboard Listener, JPanels, basic animations and complex matrices. On the last week of school, we presented our project to the computer science class, and the students loved it. Some were even requesting copies that they could take home. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, during the second half of my Design Nature class, we were told to build a bio-inspired game that would entertain 4th graders. The only premises were that we were limited to a set budget of $100, and the game should embody the animal that we chose. Our team chose the Bald Eagle, and we built our game to model the swooping and feeding behaviors of the eagle. We designed an Eagle Costume meant to provide a full-body experience, and our game was unique from others in that it was a two-stage game, the first for swooping down and grabbing fish, and the second for throwing fish into your partner's "Eagle Head" hat. For the final demonstration, real 4th graders visited Olin and came to play our games. Our play experience went extremely well, with a majority of children who played our game telling us that our game was their favorite. </p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined REVO due to my love of electrical vehicles. This was the first year that we were going to transition from "research" to "competition", so I was excited to get in on the action. The team was designing a Formula electrical racing car that would be ready for competition by the Summer of 2016. I mainly worked on the Electrical and Programming Team, designing and coding CAN, our digital data transmission bus that links together and distributes information across the car. Specifically, I worked on CAN regarding the dashboard, Watchdog, and throttle sensing. We presented our work so far at the Olin Expo, having finished the design portion, and ready for the fabrication portion next semester.</p>

							<p class="content-body">In the Spring of 2016, we began fabrication, and I continued to work on CAN nodes for the car. As deadlines began appearing on the horizon, the entire Programming team was put into Electrical. I worked on Charging and IMD, as well as PCB boards for the Atmega microcontrollers that CAN would be programmed into. I also helped with fabrication of the electrical portions, such as soldering boards and testing already fabricated pieces. In the end, I was unable to attend the competition myself due to schedule conflicts, but apparently we did pretty well for a first year competition team, placing 2nd in Design and 7th overall.</p>

							<p class="content-body">While I am proud of the work that I've done with the team, my feelings towards REVO have begun to change. I originally thought of REVO as a place to learn more about electrical vehicles, but now I feel it's more just about how to build a car for competition. Whether that's something I'm still interested in, I'm not entirely sure yet. Only time will tell.</p>

							<p class="content-body">During my four years at William P. Clements High School from 2011-2015, I was part of the MAO Math Club at our school. I participated in every meeting and practiced for competitions, but I always felt that communication between members and officers was lacking, and our member attendace was dropping over the years. When I became Webmaster my senior year, I revamped the club website, improving user-interface and accessibility. Members became more aware of the various opportunities to volunteer and compete, as well as more informed about the club's activities. I also worked with the other officers and paved the way for the founding of what is now known as MNHS - MAO National Honor Society. MAO became a dual club, one for the original competition club, and the other which held members who liked math and wanted to meet and discuss cool math topics but didn't want to deal with competitive pressure. MAO has now become an intellectual hub at Clements, with over 100 members and rising.</p>

						<p class="content-body">From 2013-2015, I was part of the International Club, a group that exempified the diversity of culture at our school and which culminated in the school's annual International Festival, where the school celebrated and honored the many different regions of the world. In 2014, I became Artistic Director and was responsible for the cultural decorations for the festival. I helped design giant murals that marked the greatest cultural mythologies of the world and then managed decoration sessions to create and paint these giant murals. I also introduced new ideas to the festival such as cultural games and art galleries to showcase artifacts from around the world. The decorations committee finished a month early ahead of schedule, and then went on the make more decorations beyond the original standard. The International Festival that year was record-breaking and was our largest attendance to date.</p>

We practiced for competition, with the hopes that we would qualify for the annual State Tournament with a shot at being the best in the state. I debated competitively for 4 years, qualifying two times for the Debate TFA State Tournament, and once making it into the Texas Top 50. I was also once crowned Debate MVP of my team in 2011. During my time with the club, I volunteered to help create a website that would help with communication, information posting, and document distribution among members. This was the first website I ever made. In my final year, I passed down my skills to underclassmen by running workshops and teaching novices how to debate.</p>
