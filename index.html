			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>I am freshman at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. While not declared, I plan to major in either General Engineering with a concentration in Computing, or Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am currently stuck in a love triangle between software and circuitry, and as a growing boy hungry for knowledge, I just can't say no to either one!</p>

			<p>Despite my life struggles with these two lovely subjects, I do have an extensive software background. I have taken 4 years of formal training in Java programming, and I have self-taught myself Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and some C and PHP. In addition, I am also an extremely fast learner: I learned both HTML5 and JavaScript to a proficient level in about a week each, so I am confident that I can pick up other languages and nuances such as Ruby, MySQL, or advanced C quickly and be put to good use as soon as possible. </p>

			<br>

			</blockquote>

			<br>
			<br>

			<p>In the past, I have worked as a Treasury Intern for Boxer Property Management Corporation and have done research at University of Texas on zebrafish and optic proteins. I have also collaborated on side projects such as recreating the popular mobile app game '2048'. Presently, I am involved in a multitude of activities at Olin, such as Electrical Vehicles, Aquaponics, and Robotics. I also actively compete in Hackathons and continue to collaborate on side projects, such as building a personal electric GoKart to drive to the dining hall and exploring web development.  </p>

			<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing frisbee and tennis, listening to music, learning new things about software and circuitry, cooking, hanging out with friends, and daydreaming about chickens (they're kind of my thing).</p>

			<h3>GoBikes ONLINE</h3>

			<p>In November 2015, I attended my first hackathon at HackHolyoke. Having been at Olin for a while, I was dissatisfied with the college's bike rental system, where the sole means of "rental" was a clipboard hanging from the ceiling. With a team that was formed onsite, we developed a web app that put Olin's bike rental system on the internet. The web app could manage and monitor all the bikes allowed for rental, giving user-friendly access to checkouts, checkins, reservations, and problem reports. The app was made using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. I wrote all of the back-end that required HTML5 and Javascript, and the my teammates styled everything with CSS. Our team won 4th place best Hack overall, and 2nd place for Most Societally Beneficial Hack.</p>

			<h3>SmartLite</h3>

			<p>Also in November 2015, I attended my second hackathon at Codestellation in Brandeis. Inspired by a friend who once texted on her phone and walked straight into a wall on her way to class, my team decided to build a smart LED that could change color depending on the content of received messages. The theory was that this smart LED would allow cell phone owners to know what messages might be about beforehand and reduce time spenting looking at texts. For the purposes of the hackathon, we evaluated messages on Twitter based on a positivity standard. The project combined Python Twitter API, machine learning, Arduino, and cross platform integration. When a message was sent on Twitter containing a certain hashtag, a python script would catch it and run it through a machine learning program that generated a number based on posivitiy. This number would then be beamed to the Serial Port of an Arduino, where it would be processed to make an LED shine a specific color. I was involved in all parts of the project, mainly spearheading the Arduino portion and cross platform integration bewteen Python and Arduino, and helping out on machine learning. Our project won the award for Most Challenging Hack.</p>

			<h3>Fly like an Eagle</h3>

			<p>In the Fall of 2015, during the second half of my Design Nature class, we were told to build a bio-inspired game that would entertain 4th graders. The only premises were that we were limited to a set budget of $100, and the game should embody the animal that we chose. Our team chose the Bald Eagle, and we built our game to model the swooping and feeding behaviors of the eagle. We designed an Eagle Costume meant to provide a full-body experience, and our game was unique from others in that it was a two-stage game, the first for swooping down and grabbing fish, and the second for throwing fish into your partner's "Eagle Head" hat. For the final demonstration, real 4th graders visited Olin and came to play our games. Our play experience went extremely well, with a good number of children telling us upfront that our game was their favorite. </p>

			<h3>Ultrasound 2D Image Processor</h3>

			<p>In the Fall of 2015, for my final project in Introduction to Sensors, Instruments, and Measurements, we were told to utlize what we had learned throughout the semester and make something "cool". My partner and I decided to create an ultrasound range finder that would spin in a circle and then process the distance points it found to produce a bird's eye view of its surroundings. The range finder was built with a breadboard and circuitry, then attached to a motor on a mount. It was connected to an arduino that would receive the data and send it to a third-party processing program that would then plot the points on an axis in real time. I worked mainly on programming the Arduino and third-party processor and integrating the Arduino into the range finder circuit that my partner built. Come demonstration day, we showed our project to the class, and were met with astounding praise. </p>

			<h3>Edwin the Robot</h3>

			<p>In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined the school's Robotics Lab, eager to learn more about robots and how they worked. I decided to work with the lab's head programmer on Edwin, a robotic arm. Our objective was to program Edwin to respond to certain stimuli and interact with users with poses and gestures. Coding was done in Python, and ROS was used as the bridge between Python and Edwin. I mainly focused on creating motion algorithms that Edwin would use to respond to certain signals from the user. At the Olin Expo, we presented our semester's work, which culminated in Edwin playing Tic-Tac-Toe against himself. Our presentation went really well, and many were fascinated in our robot's ability to draw the grid and shapes so accurately.</p>

			<h3>Aquaponics</h3>

			<p>In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined a team of individuals that embarked on an extension of the original "Olin Workshop on the Library", a remodeling of the library to include a giant aquaponics aquarium. Aquaponics is like sustainable hydroponics, where marine and plants live in a symbiotic relationship The plan is to eventually incorporate this idea into the library and make things embody the Olin Culture a bit better. Our first plan was to build a small operating aquaponics system to prove feasibility. I was mainly involved in the electrial portion of the project, designing and creating the relay system, monitor system, pumps, and lights. We presented the result of a semester's worth of work at the Olin Expo, where we demonstrated a functional system. Students and faculty alike were excited at our progress and looking forward to our efforts next semester.</p>

			<h3>REVO - Research of Electrical Vehicles at Olin</h3>

			<p>In the Fall of 2015, my first semester at Olin College, I joined REVO due to my love of electrical vehicles. This was the first year that we were going to transition from "research" to "competition", so I was excited to get in on the action. The team was designing a Formula electrical racing car that would be ready for competition by the Summer of 2016. I mainly worked on the Programming Team, designing and coding CAN, our digital data transmission bus that links together and distributes information across the car. Specifically, I worked on CAN regarding the dashboard, Watchdog, and throttle sensing. We presented our work so far at the Olin Expo, having finished the design portion, and ready for the fabrication portion next semester. </p>

			<h3>2048</h3>

			<p>In the Spring of 2015, my final semester at William P. Clements High School, I collaborated with two friends to take on the challenge of recreating the popular mobile app game "2048" in Java. Having taken 4 years of formal Java training class at Clements, I felt it was time to test my skills. The game was expanded to not only recreate the original mode, but also include a beginner's mode and a two player mode where competitiors could race to reach 512 first. I was mainly involved with coding the homepage screen, the two-player mode, and the original mode. We utilized many things we learned previously but also learned many new concepts such as Mouse and Keyboard Listener, JPanels, basic animations and complex matrices. On the last week of school, we presented our project to the computer science class, and the students loved it. Some were even requesting copies that they could take home. </p>

			<h3>Opthamology - Connexin Research</h3>

			<p> During 2014-2015, my entire senior year at William P. Clements High School, I worked as a research intern at UT Health at the Medical Center in Houston. I was looking into visual sciences, specifically examining proteins within the eye and how they all connected together to form the massive network that allows humans to see. Under the direction of Dr. O'Brien, I experimenting on zebrafish eyes to determine co-localization and possible coupling mechanisms involved in the proteins in their eyes. I gained many useful skills for the lab, including cryosectioning, immunostaining, and high-end microscopy. I also learned more about opthamology and about scientific research in a profressional laboratory. The internship concluded with a presentation of my work to lab associates and officials. Ultimately, I helped my department secure a grant for further research. </p>

			<h3>Boxer Property Management Corporation</h3>

			<p>During the summer of 2014, I worked as a Treasury Intern at Boxer Property. I mainly worked on the annual Closing and Property Analysis. I created Electricity, Tax, and Escalation Reconciliations for over 40 properties, collaborated with coworkers on Balance Sheet Reports and Acquisitions Reports, and even worked directly under the CEO. I was offered a second internship at the company the summer of 2015. This time I was given a larger role in the company, expanding from the Treasury department to the Financial and AR departments. I created reconciliations for all owned properties, worked with others on Boxer F2 Appraisal Reports, and also compiled Due Diligence Reports directly for the CFO. I learned a lot about the field of finance, and Boxer has also given me the opportunity to return for future internships, proving my value to the company.</p>

			<h3>MAO - Mu Alpha Theta</h3>

			<p>During my four years at William P. Clements High School from 2011-2015, I was part of the MAO Math Club at our school. I participated in every meeting and practiced for competitions, but I always felt that communication between members and officers was lacking, and our member attendace was dropping over the years. When I became Webmaster my senior year, I revamped the club website, improving user-interface and accessibility. Members became more aware of the various opportunities to volunteer and compete, as well as more informed about the club's activities. I also worked with the other officers and paved the way for the founding of what is now known as MNHS - MAO National Honor Society. MAO became a dual club, one for the original competition club, and the other which held members who liked math and wanted to meet and discuss cool math topics but didn't want to deal with competitive pressure. MAO has now become an intellectual hub at Clements, with over 100 members and rising.</p>

			<h3>International Club</h3>

			<p>From 2013-2015, I was part of the International Club, a group that exempified the diversity of culture at our school which culminated in the school's annual International Festival, where the school celebrated and honored the many different regions of the world. In 2014, I became Artistic Director and was responsible for the cultural decorations for the festival. I helped design giant murals that marked the greatest cultural mythologies of the world and then managed decoration sessions to create and paint these giant murals. I also introduced new ideas to the festival such as cultural games and art galleries to showcase artifacts from around the world. The decorations committee finished a month early ahead of schedule, and then went on the make more decorations beyond the original standard. The International Festival that year was record-breaking and was our largest attendance to date.</p>

			<h3>NFL Debate</h3>

			<p>During my four years at William P. Clements High School from 2011-2015, I was part of the NFL Debate Team at our school. We practiced for competition, with the hopes that we would qualify for the annual State Tournament with a shot at being the best in the state. I debated competitively for 4 years, qualifying two times for the Debate TFA State Tournament, and once making it into the Texas Top 50. I was also once crowned Debate MVP of my team in 2011. During my time with the club, I volunteered to create a website that would help with communication, information posting, and document distribution among members. This was the first website I ever made. In my final year, I passed down my skills to underclassmen by running workshops and teaching novices how to debate.</p>
