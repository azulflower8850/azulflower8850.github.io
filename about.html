				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<div class="col-md-8">

						<p>I was always an interesting one growing up. Born in Houston, Texas, I'm told I was completely silent in my childhood, armed with chubby legs and a strong propensity for curiosity, sometimes learning things the hard way. Then come pre-K, I flip-flopped and became a loud, hungry individual. I started eating tons and talking a lot more, but my curiosity never wavered. Moving into grade school, I gradually became more and more outspoken, and I towered above my friends as a lanky beacon of laughter and silliness. Students in high school always talk about the grade school triangle: Sleep, Friends, or Knowledge, you can really only achieve two of the three. I chose to gun for all of them, and it was tough, but life isn't fun without a challenge. I graduated high school Top 5 of my class with straight As, was known as "The Zhangster", famous for his loudness, bright laughter, and reliability, and never had dark circles under my eyes, not even once. </p>

						<p>Now a junior at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, I continue to be the curious cat I always was, now just less loud and more goofy. I immerse myself in my studies, discovering a passion in robotics and software. I decided that the traditional computing major at my college wasn't good enough, so I merged two career trees into one to make my own major, Computational Robotics. I now work hard to learn all that I can about both computer science and artificial intelligence of mobile robots. </p>

						<p>As my major suggests, I do have an extensive software background. I have now taken 4 years of formal training in programming using Java, and I have also taken 3 years of college level software courses in Python. In addition, I have self-taught myself C++, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and some C, PHP, and SQL. Besides coding, I am also very familiar with many robotics topics, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotic planning, and sensor fusion. I am also an extremely fast learner: I taught myself Reinforcement Learning to a proficient level in less than a month and am actively learning more C++ programming chops by the week. I am constantly engaged in self-learning and am always looking for a fun, challenging endeavor to work on. </p>

						"Kevin ... worked on a system for helping with internal testing, interfacing with various sets of hardware and writing algorithms based on data received from said hardware. He jumped right into the challenge, learning the project background quickly, and contributed significantly to the success of the project ... The work resulted in a technology concept which will add to the patent portfolio at Ivani. Kevinâ€™s natural intelligence and commitment to the company were evident throughout the summer. He naturally adapted to our culture, while impacting it in a positive way. Having Kevin work with us for the summer was awesome, and I would not hesitate in recommending him to future employers."

						<p>Most recently, my endeavors have led me to intern at nuTonomy, a bustling startup with a vision to revolutionize urban transporation through their software, nuCore, a system designed to put autonomous cars on the road. There, I was so far ahead of my main project schedule that I self-initiated my own side projects, including optimizing a section of the codebase for efficiency and introducing a new planning model to the planning team pipeline. In the past, I have worked for Ivani, a startup company in Missouri that specializes in network presence sensing technology and home automation. There, I interned as a Software Development Engineer and exceeded project expectations to patent a new presence sensing technology. I have also collaborated on side projects such as building a robotic MIDI keyboard and creating a reinforcement learning environment. Presently, I am involved in a multitude of activities at Olin, such as Olin Ultimate, Olin Aquaponics, and Olin Robotics. I also compete in Hackathons and continue to work on side projects, such as learning graphic design, creating my own Jarvis home system, and building a personal cooking assistant for my adventures in the kitchen.  </p>

						<p>Outside my studies and academics, I'm still the same old me from my childhood, albeit maybe a bit more mature. I like to have fun with friends and make them laugh. I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee with our college team, and I have recently found a passion for growing my own food and cooking up new dishes, generally Asian because I currently only know that cuisine (Check out my instagram for my adventures in "Kevin's quest to become a better chef" @kzhang8850 #shamelessplug). I also like to explore various cool events around campus, such as Co-Curriculars, fun no credit classes where professors teach others about their hobbies, which include pottery and fermentation. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and tennis, listening to music, keeping up to date about the latest news in the software and robotics circles, hanging out with friends, and keeping on the lookout for the passerby chicken (I started eating a lot of chicken and then one day it became my spirit animal).</p>

						<p> As for what's next in my life, a college student's future is always quite volatile. But I do know that I plan on pursuing artificial intelligence and mobile robotics as my career path. I know that I plan on searching for more endeavors to work on, and that I plan on leading the Olin Robotics and Olin Aquaponics teams to greatness. I know that I will continue to strive to learn everything I can, because I'll always be a curious cat. I know that I will continue to chase after chickens and experiment in the kitchen. And no matter how hard I try otherwise, I know that I'll always be "The Zhangster", famous for his (now ocassional) loudness and bright laughter, and the one you can always depend on.</p>
